<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/xgnmakjht3p94i4/ewan179x184.jpg" alt="Ewan Mannington" class="content">I have worked in the Web Design/Web content management field since 2004 although my job descriptions have always included a variety of other responsibilities. My last role predominantly focused on writing content for the web and designing pages adhering to best practice guidelines. As a result I spent much of my time working with CSS, html and Photoshop to update and design content. Day to day content for the web was mostly produced within a CMS environment. </p></article>
<article><header class="pagecontent"><h3>My 5 key skills</h3></header>
<header class="pagecontent"><h4>Web design/content management</h4></header>
<p>On top of my content management roles I have also have gained significant knowledge in online marketing. I have managed and created the various social media channels, had a strong input regarding email marketing and worked on several Search Engine Optimisation campaigns.</p>
<header class="pagecontent"><h4>Writing for the web</h4></header>
<p>My previous roles have also included proof reading and content authoring responsibilities for print and online platforms. One of my additional roles in my last position was to produce regular articles for consumer magazines (print) and email newsletters. I was also one of the designated proof readers responsible with checking publications for grammatical errors/formatting inconsistencies before distribution.</p>
<header class="pagecontent"><h4>Online marketing</h4></header>
<p>I also have experience in editing and creating lengthy technical reports (up to 300 pages) highly sensitive in nature. I am familiar with Adobe InDesign but mostly used Microsoft Word to create and edit these documents. Additionally I managed the entire print/production process which included negotiating with a high profile government department to ensure tight timescales were met. I supervised a small team tasked with ensuring the document was published online and distributed error free.</p>
<header class="pagecontent"><h4>Customer Service/Client Relationship Management</h4></header>
<p>Building relationships was an important aspect of my previous position. I was the main web contact (via phone and email) for our 10,000 membership base and also took enquiries from members of the public. I am used to dealing with enquiries that arenâ€™t straight forward and am accustomed to dealing with difficult calls. These kind of enquiries differed but were mostly related to software or browser glitches. They could also include more specific queries (sometime complaints) with the quality of service clients thought they were getting for their membership fee. In these cases it was my responsibility to address their concerns and persuade them not to leave.</p>
<header class="pagecontent"><h4>Proof reading/editing/content authoring (pring and online)</h4></header>
<p>The five skills I would like to think represent my skill set best would be the following:</p>
<ul><li>Web design/Web Content Management</li>
<li>Writing for the web</li>
<li>Online marketing</li>
<li>Customer Service/Client Relationship Management</li>
<li>Proof reading/editing /content authoring(print and online)</li></ul>
